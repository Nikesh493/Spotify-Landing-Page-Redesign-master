# Spotify-Landing-Page-Redesign-master

I developed a clone music app page using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean and responsive design that mirrors the user experience of popular music streaming platforms. The page features a dynamic music player with play, pause, and skip functionalities, allowing users to interact with the interface seamlessly. By leveraging CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript for interactivity, the project delivers a visually appealing and fully functional frontend without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.
